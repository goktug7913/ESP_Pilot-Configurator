# ESP_Pilot-Configurator
ESP Pilot Configurator application for PC

ESP Pilot uses a custom serial messaging protocol for communicating with this application. For now, you need to be connected via USB, but I'm planning on adding nRF24 and BT/WiFi connections too.

This application is written in Qt 6.0.0-beta2
